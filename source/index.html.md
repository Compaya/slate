curl "https://api.cpsms.dk/v2/endpoint"
  -H "Authorization: Basic bGFyc3ZpbmRlcjpHdWxlR3VtbWlzdMO4dmxlcg=="

```php

<?php
$username = "Your CPSMS username";
$apiKey = "Your generated key";

CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
    "Authorization: Basic " . base64_encode($username . ':' . $apiKey)
);
```





> Make sure to replace $username and $apiKey with your own credentials.

`Authorization: Basic <base64 encoding>`
